<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
<!--
    This is an absolute link. Example: protocol://domain/path
    Here we see the "https://" is contained within the link. This is absolute
-->

<a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
<!--
    "pages/about.html" also works without the "./" syntax in front,
    but it might cause issues.
    
    By adding ./ you are specifying to your code that it should start 
    looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.
