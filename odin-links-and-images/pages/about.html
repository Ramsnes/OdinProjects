    <img src="../images/dog.jpg">
<!--

  - scr tells the browser where the image file is located
  
  
  - With the ../ syntax, the dog.jpg may be used, even if 'about.html' can't
  natively reach the 'image folder'.
  
  We need access to the image directory with the 'img-link':

  The two dots (..) goes up one directory (../), just like 'cd' in terminal.
  
  Now, we have access to the 'image' directory, which is located
  in the root directory one 'level' up above the 'about.html'.

  Example used: <img src=../images/dog.jpg

  "using ../ in a filepath is kind of like stepping out from the 
  room you are currently in to the main hallway so you can go to
  another room." (Odin)
